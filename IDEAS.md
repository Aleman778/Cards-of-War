# Game Ideas
The theme of this jam is "Joined Together", "...at least two elements are connected together in some way.", "What does it mean for them to be joined?", "What does it mean for them to break?".

## Gameplay Ideas
- Switch between two player that have different abilities, puzzle game.
  - You might loose one of the player this reducing you abilties.
- Two players joined together with a rope (or chain upgrade), puzzle game.
  - Spikes is an enemy.
  - One player can freeze the rope.
  - You control one player and can only control the other player when they are connected via the rope.
- Two types of movement e.g. move left and move right, you might loose one of those abilities.
- Game using die, the number determines the attack damage, maybe also connect this with card games.
- In this world you grow balls from you hair and they can be used to throw as an attack, but the main character weilds a baseball bat and can counter the attacks.
- Slime (e.g. from terraria) you connect multiple slimes by jumping into each other (sort of similar
to katamari series), you might also be able to collect other things in the slime like trees, rocks etc. There might be things that cuts you slime in half and you have to find it to grow back. Like katamari it may use a time limit with a height requirement.
- Turn-based strategy game where you move pieces on a grid but movement and attack are connected to cards in the player's hand. You can choose one movement card e.g. move 5 grid units, move any number of grid units left or right. Then you optionally pick an attack card enemies, e.g. attack within a radius of 2, might be another card that lets you go berserk and can instead move and attack freely (controllably or uncontrollably) (which breaks the two joined mechanics cards/movement/attack). The enemy would be a bot, optionally another player.
  - You have a set number of actions each turn e.g. two, so you can move twice, attack and move, move and attack, two attack.
